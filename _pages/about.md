I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer SCIENCE & Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) at [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I'm a member of [GroupLens Research Lab](https://grouplens.org/). My advisor is [Prof. Svetlana Yarosh](http://lanayarosh.com/). My research in [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) focuses on understanding user behaviors and user-generated content in online communities. I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).
